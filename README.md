# Chimera

Chimera is an experimental open source publisher template built using Flutter. It combines the DNA of the Android and iOS native applications into something new based on our lessons learned from building publisher applications over the past three years. We examine what is possible and experiment with pushing the boundaries of what a Vusr Publisher application can do.

Chimera addresses the needs of the end user, having a lightweight and performant app not possible with 3D physics engines, and the needs of the publisher, having the same native application deploy to iOS and Android platforms.
